## Introduction

When it comes to Web application security, one of the recommendations to write software that is resilent to attacks is to perform input data validation. However, as Mobile applications and APIs (Application Programming Interface) proliferates, the number of untrusted sources of data goes up, and a potential attacker can take advantage of the lack of validations to compromise our applications.

Regular expressions provides a versatile mechanism to perform input data validation. Developers use them to validate email addresses, zip codes, phone numbers and many other task that are easily implemented throught them.

Unfortunately not all the Software engineers fully understand how regular expressions works in the background and by choosing a regular expression pattern they can introduce a risk in the application. In this article we are going to discuss about a so called Regular Expression Denial of the service vulnerability and how we can identify this problems early in the Sofware Development Life Cycle (SDLC) stages by enforcing a culture focused on Unit Testing.
